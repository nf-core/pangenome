In practice, these often occur in regions of low alignment quality, which are typical of areas with large INDELs and structural variations in the wfmash alignments. This underalignment is then resolved in the smoothxg step. Removing short matches can simplify the graph and remove spurious relationships caused by short repeated homologies.\nA setting of --seqwish_min_match_length 47 is optimal for around 5% divergence, and we suggest lowering it for higher divergence and increasing it for lower divergence. Values up to --seqwish_min_match_length 311 work well for human haplotypes. In effect, setting --seqwish_min_match_length to N means that we can tolerate a local pairwise difference rate of no more than 1/N. Thus, INDELs which may be represented by complex series of edit operations will be opened into bubbles in the induced graph, and alignment regions with very low identity will be ignored. Using affine-gapped alignment (such as with minimap2) may reduce the impact of this step by representing large indels more precisely in the input alignments.

However, we can't really expect to pairwise map all sequences together and obtain well separated connected components. It is likely to get a giant connected component, and probably a few smaller ones, due to incorrect mappings or false homologies. This might unnecessarily increase the computational burden, as well as complicate the downstream analyzes. Therefore, it is recommended to split up the input sequences into communities in order to find the latent structure of their mutual relationship. For example, the communities can represent the different chromosomes of the input genomes.\n<Warning> If you know in advance that your sequences present particular rearrangements (like rare chromosome translocations), you might consider skipping this step or tuning it accordingly to your biological questions.\n",
