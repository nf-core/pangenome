  description: The pangenome graph construction pipeline renders a collection of sequences
    into a pangenome graph. Its goal is to build a graph that is locally directed
    and acyclic while preserving large-scale variation. Maintaining local linearity
    is important for interpretation, visualization, mapping, comparative genomics,
    and reuse of pangenome graphs
